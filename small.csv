though she probably wouldn't have won anyways, Justine has gotten absolutely screwed by Jeremy this season."
2,FointyPinger,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='ind28rl')>,ind28rl,14,1662497087.0,"I hope it's Chris, I found him A Bit Much in the first few episodes but mid-season onwards he's stealthily become my favourite. Episode 9 totally sealed the deal. 'Scuse your fucking mouth!"
3,GrandpaDallas,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='inc6ywo')>,inc6ywo,9,1662485184.0,Honestly Chris was a favorite from the get-go but I'm okay with either of the two (obvious) choices. Josh is also excellent.
4,monaco_wedding,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='indd39p')>,indd39p,3,1662501358.0,"I like Chris slightly more because he's more chaotic, but they are both wonderful and worthy of the win. That said, Chris has been unstoppable for the past few episodes so he's due for a stumble--I have a feeling Josh may carry his lead all the way to the finish line.

Honestly my main hope going into the final is that Justine can somehow get an episode win under the wire. I really think she deserves to be a good 10ish points higher in the season ranking, based on all the times Jeremy screwed her over."

6,Italapas,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='incmwsp')>,incmwsp,2,1662491289.0,I kinda want it to be Josh but it might equally well be Chris.

8,Esteban2808,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='incs26o')>,incs26o,1,1662493263.0,"Hope it's josh considering he has lead for 9 episodes, but with run Chris is having I think he will end up taking it out."
9,tunaburn,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='ind9n8z')>,ind9n8z,1,1662499951.0,"I'm pretty sure Chris is so far out in the lead he can't lose at this point. 

I noticed they didn't show the overall scores last episode and I assume that's why."
10,Latter-Ad6308,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='indylm1')>,indylm1,1,1662510866.0,"I feel like Josh is in with the best chance. He’s one of those contestants that just gets Taskmaster and almost always understands the assignment and pulls it off flawlessly.

However, Chris has really come into his own in the back half of the season, and I wouldn’t be all surprised to see him take it.

Either way, both are worthy winners in my book."
11,doublelxp,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='inf8d58')>,inf8d58,1,1662535958.0,Josh was my early favorite but I think Chris is a better player and has won me over. Is there really just one point separating the two? Nailbiter for sure.
